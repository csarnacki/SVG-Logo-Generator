# SVG-Logo-Generator

This project is designed to generate a user selected SVG logo using the CLI. It takes advantage of Node.js, and packages including fs and inquirer. It also uses Jest to complete functional testing for creating of various shapes.

The user answers the questions in their terminal and then the specific shape they chose is created in the corresponding color they selected. The user also selects up to three letters to include on the shape, however, that process is not fully functional at this time and I am currently working on debugging the text to display.

I am also currently working on debugging the test file as the tests all fail despite the expected and received lines being the same when the tests are run.
